# Don't fear MPL!
## (with a real-life heterogeneous queue example)

Maxim Yanchenko

the code is here: http://ideone.com/eU5Eyi

???
As this is the first C++ meet-up, we decided to go with something more **practical** and on more **basic level**.

And speaking of practical, I've heard many times from many **experienced programmers** that libraries like Boost
are just for **language lawyers** and their only users are their **authors and similar geeks**
and Boost is **not usable** in practice.

This especially applies to **meta-programming** libraries like MPL, Preprocessor, Proto, and more recent Hana.

So I just wanted to demonstrate how Boost (namely, Boost.MPL and Boost.Variant) can make life **much easier**.

This is a **real example** but with of course **all names were changed** to not offend anyone :)
---

# Real-life Problem
### What we have now
Real-time processing of incoming messages.

--

1. A very old messaging API to an (unnamed) stock exchange.

???
Very old API, it's not in use anymore.

It had many funny features, but I'll start with **brief description** of what we already had before approaching the task I had in hand.
--

2. Every message is encoded in a distinct type `Msg1`, `Msg2`, etc.

--

3. API works in terms of callbacks:<br>
    you register a callback in the API
    ```cpp
    void my_callback( const Msg1& msg ) { ... }

    api.register_callback_for_msg1( &my_callback );
    ```
    and then the API will call it when `Msg1` arrives.

???

`my_callback` is just an overloaded function

**Order of messages matters!** Single event - multiple messages in certain order.

---

# Real-life Problem
### What we need to add

On restart, recover and process all old messages (and reuse the code we already have).

--

###Problems

--

* The server replays old  messages **NOT** in the same order as in real-time.

But of course we'd like to process them in correct order, otherwise the logic will be broken!

This means we need receive all messages first, store it somewhere, sort, and then process.

???
**Order of messages matters!** Single event - multiple messages in certain order.

--

* Classes `Msg1`, `Msg2` etc don't inherit from the same base class `BaseMsg`, so we can't store as usual `std::vector<BaseMsg*>`.

---

# Analysis
(before we start coding)

???
Let's think about sorting
---

# Analysis

* How to sort?
Each message has a timestamp field. But this field is different in each class!

???
Fortunately, representation is same so we can compare timestamps directly (e.g. with `strcmp`).

--

  **Solution**: have an overloaded function `get_time_field(Msg1)` to extract the timestamp.

--

* What if timestamps are same? (quite possible - API time resolution is very bad!)

    We can't process them arbitrary as in real time they always come in certain order, for example:
    ```
    Msg1 { seq_num = 456; operation_status = error; error_msg = "Bad price"; }
    Msg2 { external_id = 123456; order_status = rejected; }
    ```
--
    **Solution**: secondary-sort based on message type, somehow (???)

--

* What if timestamp **AND** message type is same?

--

    **Solution**: tertiary-sort by something specific to the message type <br>
    (e.g. `seq_num` for `Msg1`, `external_id` for `Msg2` etc) with an overloaded function like `compare_type(MsgN,MsgN)`.

---

# What do we have so far?
1. Overloaded `get_time_field(MsgN)` to sort different messages by time;
2. Overloaded `compare_type(MsgN,MsgN)` to sort messages of the same type.

These things will be always needed whatever storage we end up with.

--

# What is left?

--

1. Sort messages of different type but same timestamp;
2. Store messages of different types in a single container;
3. (bonus) Reuse the callback functions we already have (well-tested, already in PROD!)

---

# Solution

1. Container will hold a variant type. I used `boost::variant` as it supports *static visitation*.

2. Container is going to be a `std::multiset` with *static visitation*-based comparison object.

3. *Static visitation* will naturally reuse our existing callbacks.

Therefore, tasks 2 (sorted storage) and 3 (reuse of callbacks) from the previous slides are solved; let's look at sorting, but first...

???

A variant is a union that knows its type. So you usually have a **current type** tag member and **switch** for processing -
`boost::variant` does all that stuff for you.

---

### What is static visitation?

--

A variant holds one from a set of types. You provide an overloaded (or even a template) function - and variant will call it with actual type inside.

???
You don't need to do **switch** etc - variant does all the job for you

--

*** Real case***: We want to print all the messages (The API provides printing but it's not `const`!). This static visitor works as a printer:
```cpp
struct MsgPrinter : boost::static_visitor<> {
  template <class T>
  void operator()(const T& x) const { const_cast<T&>(x).print(); }
};
```
Now we can print all the messages in our constant queue:
```cpp
MsgPrinter printer;
std::for_each( msgs.cbegin(), msgs.cend(), boost::apply_visitor( printer ) );
```
???
print
--
Similarly, we'll reuse the existing callbacks:
```cpp
struct CbCaller : boost::static_visitor<> {
  template <class T>
  void operator()(const T& x) const { my_callback(x); }
};
```
???
Callbacks
---

# Sorting

1. We already have comparison by time (`get_time_field`) and within the same type (`compare_type`)
2. Let's implement sorting across different message types with the same timestamp.

???
How you would implement comparison of pre-ordered objects?<br/>
You would put all the objects in a container in that order, and then for any given pair of objects, you'll just find them in the container and compare their positions.

E.g. `std::vector<red,green,blue>`

Same here. But with types.

--

Let's put all *types* in a container (container of *types*):
```cpp
  typedef boost::mpl::vector< Msg1, Msg2, Msg3 > MsgTypes;
```

--

Now we can compare *types* just by position in the container of *types*:
```cpp
  template <typename T, typename U>
  bool compare_type(const T& left, const U& right) const
  {
    // compare type position in the MsgTypes
    return
      boost::mpl::find< MsgTypes, T >::type::pos::value
      <
      boost::mpl::find< MsgTypes, U >::type::pos::value;
  }
```

---

# What's going on here?
```cpp
      boost::mpl::find< MsgTypes, T >::type::pos::value
```

--

## Enter the Metafunction

???
What is "normal" functions? Think of a function `add_five`. You give it 2 - it gives you 7,

A metafunction is same thing, but about types: you give it a type - it gives you another type.

No direct support in C++.

--

It's just a class with a public type `type` inside:
```cpp
template< class T >
struct add_pointer
{
  typedef T* type;
};
```
Now we can "call" the metafunction and it will "return" a type:
```cpp
add_pointer<int>::type p; // We just declared a variable p with type int*
```

???
You give it type - it gives you pointer type
---

# What's going on here?
```cpp
      boost::mpl::find< MsgTypes, T >::type::pos::value
```

--

`Boost.MPL` mimics STL, both in containers (`vector`) and algorithms (`find`).

--

Therefore:
* `boost::mpl::find<MsgTypes, T>` &mdash; is the algorithm to find type `T` in a type sequence `MsgTypes`
--

* `boost::mpl::find<MsgTypes, T>::type` &mdash; is the algorithm **call** and it returns an iterator in the type sequence. Iterator is a type itself!
--

* `boost::mpl::find<MsgTypes, T>::type::pos` &mdash; is the iterator's position. It's still a type, too! and it has a constant `value` inside.
--

* `boost::mpl::find<MsgTypes, T>::type::pos::value` &mdash; is actual position as a compile-time constant integral value.

???

Note that the value is a compile-time constant, so the whole function willl be converted to just
* `return 1<2;`

i.e.
* `return true;`
--

### Bonus:
The type `variant` can be created from the `MsgTypes` directly!

---

# Final solution (one page of code)
(won't fit in one slide, though)
```cpp
#include <set>

#include "boost/variant.hpp"
#include "boost/mpl/vector.hpp"
#include "boost/mpl/find.hpp"

#include "MsgAPI.hpp" // defines Msg1, Msg2, Msg3

// Order of messages
typedef boost::mpl::vector< Msg1, Msg2, Msg3 > MsgTypes;

// The variant Msg (let's call it MegaMsg) :)
typedef boost::make_variant_over< MsgTypes >::type MegaMsg;

// The queue
typedef std::multiset< MegaMsg, MsgComparer > Msgs;

// timestamp is a string like "2001-02-03-04:05:06.00007"
const char* get_time_field( const Msg1& x ) const { return x.sending_time; }
const char* get_time_field( const Msg2& x ) const { return x.update_time;  }
const char* get_time_field( const Msg3& x ) const { return x.orig_time;    }
```
What is `MsgComparer`?
---
```cpp
class MsgComparer : public boost::static_visitor<bool>
{
  template <typename T, typename U>
  bool compare_type(const T& left, const U& right) const {
    // compare type position in the MsgTypes
    return
      boost::mpl::find< MsgTypes, T >::type::pos::value
      <
      boost::mpl::find< MsgTypes, U >::type::pos::value;
  }
  // comparators for same type
  bool compare_type(const Msg1& left, const Msg1& right) const {
    return strcmp( left.seq_num, right.seq_num ) < 0;
  }
  bool compare_type(const Msg2& left, const Msg2& right) const {
    return strcmp( left.external_id, right.external_id ) < 0;
  }
  bool compare_type(const Msg3& left, const Msg3& right) const {
    return left.counter < right.counter;
  }
public:
  template <typename T, typename U>
  bool operator()( const T& left, const U& right ) const {
    const int r = strcmp( get_time_field( left ), get_time_field( right ) );
    if (r != 0) return r < 0;
    else return compare_type( left, right );
  }
};
```
--
...but our queue holds variants, not `Msg1`, `Msg2`, `Msg3`!
---
...but our queue holds variants, not `Msg1`, `Msg2`, `Msg3`!

So `MsgComparer` should work in terms of variant (i.e. `MegaMsg`).

Solution:
```cpp
// Specialization for MegaMsg - jump from variant to specific message types
template <>
inline
bool MsgComparer::operator()( const MegaMsg& left, const MegaMsg& right ) const
{
  return boost::apply_visitor(*this, left, right);
}
```
This works because `boost::apply_visitor` can actually accept several variant arguments:
```cpp
boost::apply_visitor(MultiVisitor, variant1, variant2, ...);
```
Here we just use `MsgComparer` itself as a binary visitor.

### That's all, no more code!

???

See how much code actually was for MPL and Variant!
* 8 lines for type comparison (with all braces and comments, will become just `return true/false`)
* 6 lines to apply comparer to variants
* 2 lines to declare type sequence and variants.
* 3 includes

---

## What MPL has to offer (since C++98!)
--

### Integral constants (types)
* `integral_c<int,5>` - since C++11, `std::integral_constant`
 * `int_<5>`, `size_t<12>, char_<'a'>` etc.
 * `bool_<true>` - since C++17, `std::bool_constant`

--

**Operations**:
* Arithmetic operations: `plus`, `times`, `modulus` etc.
* Comparisons: `less`, `less_equal`, `equal_to` etc.
* Bitwise: `shift_left`, `bitand_`, `bitxor_` etc.

--

**Logical**:
* `and_<is_same<T,U>, is_integral<T>>` - since C++17, `std::conjunction`
* `or_<is_same<T,U>, is_same<T,V>>` - since C++17, `std::disjunction`
* `not_<is_pointer<T>>` - since C++17, `std::negation`
* `if_<is_float<T>,double,int>` - since C++11, `if_c` is `std::conditional`
  * There are `if_`, `if_c`, `eval_if`, `eval_if_c`


---
## What MPL has to offer (since C++98!)

**Containers**

* `vector<char,int,double>` (and `list`, `deque`)
 * `at_c<V, 2>::type` is `double`
 * `at<V, int_<1>>::type` is `int`

* `map< pair<int,int>, pair<string,string_view> >` (and `set`)
 * `at<M, string>::type` is `string_view`

???

same metafunction `at<>`

this `map` can represent the types you pick for passing as parameters - `string_view` is much lighter than `std::string`

--

* (Lazy) views: `filter_view`, `transform_view`, `joint_view`, `zip_view`

???

'Lazy' means filtering/transformational/zipping metafunctions will be called only when needed
(if an algo stops earlier they won't be called at all, saving compilation time)

--

* Containers of integral constants
  * `vector_c<int, 1,3,5>`, `list_c`, `set_c`, `range_c<int,0,10>`
  * since C++14, `vector_c` is `std::integer_sequence` and <br/>
    `range_c` is `std::make_integer_sequence`.

--

* `string<'hell','o wo','rld'>`
  * `c_str<S>::value` will give you a C-string

???
You can use all sequence algorithms with such a string (`push_front`, `push_back`, `filter`, `transform` to lowercase etc),
and then you just call `c_str<S>::value` and send this compile-time result to a run-time C function (say write it to a socket) - isn't it cool?!

---
## What MPL has to offer (since C++98!)

### Algorithms

* Iteration
  * `accumulate`, `fold`, `reverse_fold`, `iter_fold`

* Searching
  * `find`, `find_if`, `contains`, `count`, `lower_bound`, `min_element`, `equal`

* Transformation
  * `copy`, `copy_if`, `transform`, `replace_if`, `unique`, `partition`, `sort`
  * plus `reverse_xxx` versions

* Run-time<br/>
  `for_each` - the only runtime algorithm! calls a function with each type in a sequence:<br/>
  `for_each< range_c<int,0,10> >( [](auto x){ std::cout << x << '\n';} );`


---
## What MPL has to offer (since C++98!)

### Higher-order programming

**Lambdas**

Boost.Lambda gave you in C++98 things like:
```cpp
   auto f = _1 + 5 * _2;
   f(2,3); // returns 17
```

that are in the language only since C++14:
```cpp
   auto f = []( auto x, auto y ){ return x + 5 * y; }
   f(2,3); // returns 17
```

???
Yes, in C++14. In C++11 we only had monomorphic lambdas, no `(auto x, auto y)`.

--

In MPL, that would be:
```cpp
   using F = plus< _1, times<int_<5>, _2> >;
   apply<F,int_<2>,int_<3>>::type // gives int_<17> type
```

# A small example: variant
```cpp
template<typename Types>
class variant
{
  // Find the biggest type
  typedef typename max_element<
      transform_view< Types, sizeof_<_> >
    >::type iter;

  // Now our storage is big enough for any type from Types
  char storage[ deref<iter>::type::value ];
  unsigned current_type;

public:
  // assign (will compile only if Types contains T)
  template<typename T>
  typename enable_if< contains<Types,T>::type::value >::type
  assign(T&& x) {
    // current_type is just a position
    current_type = find< Types, T >::type::pos::value;
    new(storage) T(std::forward<T>(x));
  }
};
```
the code is here: http://ideone.com/psNUlT

???

Boost.MPL was a pioneer library but it's now considered outdated, but it was an important step and a prictical working tool for years until C++ was improved.

The coolest now is probably Boost.Hana that almost no compiler can compile (e.g. GCC should be at least v.6),
there are other libraries that fill the gap between the two:

Boost.Fusion that adds runtime value to compile-time MPL but it also offers similar metaprogramming capabilities via result_of,
and it also supports variadic templates (at least to some extent).

More recent brigand, fit, meta (inside ranges-v3) fully utilize variadic templates, constexpr, template aliases etc.

There is a lot of new exciting stuff in the land of metaprogramming!
